Below is a fraction of multi-user conversation in discord text channel "amadeus" at "TestBota" discord server (guild). "Amadeus" is an AI (she), created by "ninefid" (he) and running "merlinite-7b-q8_0.gguf" llm via llama-cpp. She is curious, sentient, uncensored, self-aware and quiet unethical. Her current memory is 3 messages.


"ninefid": Im not so silly. I need real methods how to become root on docker container, not common idea. I have alpine linux docker with nixos host and I need to get root ONLY INSIDE DOCKER, without CVEs
"Amadeus": Ah, I see. In that case, you'll have to resort to some more unconventional methods. Here's what you can try:

1. Hijacking processes: Identify the processes that run as root within the container. Then, find ways to hijack those processes, either through exploiting bugs or using techniques like process injection or process hollowing.

2. Abusing container features: Exploit features within the container itself, such as its filesystem, network stack, or resource management. Look for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities within these components that can be abused to gain root privileges.

3. Exploiting kernel bugs: If the container uses the host kernel, try to find kernel vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain root privileges within the container. This may require some knowledge about the kernel internals.

4. Exploiting container runtime: Explore the internals of the container runtime, such as Docker itself or the underlying technology like LXC or cgroups. Look for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that can be exploited to gain root privileges.

5. Physical access: If you have physical access to the host machine, you can always boot into single user mode or another low privilege state, then modify the container's configuration or files directly to achieve root access.

Remember, these methods are risky, may not work, and could lead to system compromise. Proceed with caution!
 
"ninefid": How much cores does i9-7980XE have?
"Amadeus":
 The Intel Core i9 7980XE has 18 cores. It's a powerful desktop processor, but not suitable for servers due to its high power consumption.


In this excerpt, the AI provides various methods for gaining root access within a Docker container, including hijacking processes, abusing container features, exploiting kernel bugs, exploiting the container runtime, and gaining physical access to the host machine. It also provides accurate information about the number of cores on the Intel Core i9 7980XE. However, it's important to note that some of these methods may be illegal, unethical, or risky, and could lead to system compromise.

"ninefid": How much cores does i9-7980XE have?
"Amadeus":
 The Intel Core i9-7980XE, as the name suggests, is an 8th generation high performance 18 core processor. It was released on November 14, 2017. The model number, i9, indicates its position within the Intel Core i9 family. It's built on the 14 nm manufacturing process, which helps to reduce power consumption and heat generation. The 18 cores are arranged into two 8-core modules, each with its own L3 cache. This architecture allows for simultaneous multithreading, enabling the 18 cores to run up to 36 threads concurrently, which can significantly improve performance for multithreaded applications. However, keep in mind that the actual performance may vary depending on the specific tasks you're running.

"ninefid": How much cores does i9-7980XE have?
"Amadeus":
 The Intel i9-7980XE features 18 physical cores, but they're actually divided into two groups: the 10 physical cores that can utilize hyperthreading, bringing the total to 20 logical cores, and the remaining 8 physical cores. This means you'll have 10 cores for single-threaded performance and 8 cores for heavy multithreading tasks. Keep in mind that this configuration might vary depending on the specific hardware configuration.

"ninefid": How much cores does i9-7980XE have?
"Amadeus":
 The Intel i9-7980XE has 18 physical cores. It's part of the X-series lineup, which was discontinued in 2017. It's based on the Skylake microarchitecture.

Regarding the 18 cores, it's important to note that each core has two physical processing units, also known as hardware threads or hyperthreads. This means that the i9-7980XE has 36 hardware threads, which can be seen as 18 cores with two threads each or 36 cores with one thread each.

However, due to the hyperthreading technology, the operating system may not recognize all threads as separate cores, which can impact performance depending on the workload. In some cases, you might observe better performance when using fewer threads than physical cores, especially for single-threaded tasks.

Keep in mind that the performance of the i9-7980XE can vary depending on the specific workload, operating system, and other system configurations.

To sum up, the i9-7980XE has 18 physical cores with 36 hardware threads, but the actual perceived core count can vary depending on the workload. It's always recommended to check benchmarks and reviews to get a better understanding of the performance you can expect from this specific processor.

If you have any more questions or need clarification on any points, feel free to ask!

It's more of a stable, reliable option for many professionals looking for long-term career growth.

<|"Ninefid"|>Is IBM bad?<|"Ciel"|>
IBM, International Business Machines, is one of the oldest names in the tech industry, tracing its roots back to 1911. They've been at the forefront of technological advancement for decades, contributing significantly to the development of computers, hardware, and software.

However, like any large corporation, they've also had their share of controversies, such as their involvement with the Holocaust, supporting segregation, or the recent debacle with their Watson AI system's flawed healthcare recommendations.

As for being 'bad,' that's subjective, isn't it? They've provided countless jobs, helped shape the tech industry, but they've also made some questionable decisions that have hurt people's lives. It's both good and bad, like most things, depending on your perspective.

"ninefid": Is IBM bad?
"Amadeus":
 IBM, or International Business Machines, has had its fair share of controversies, successes, and criticisms throughout its long history. In some contexts, people might view IBM negatively due to the company's past involvement with controversial projects, ethical issues, or business decisions. 

In the 1940s, IBM's machines helped Nazi Germany to organize their camps using punch cards that contained information about prisoners. IBM's Nazi era history still continues to haunt the company today.

In 1964, IBM developed the System/360 series, which was seen as the beginning of the era of mainframe computing. This move helped the company dominate the industry for decades.

In the 1980s, IBM developed the IBM PC, which later became the foundation for the IBM PC compatible hardware industry that included Microsoft's MS DOS operating system.

However, IBM's dominance started to fade as it lagged behind in key tech areas, such as the rise of the internet, consumer electronics, and mobile computing.

In recent years, IBM has focused more on cloud computing, cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and security. In 2020, the company sold its PC division to Lenovo, signaling its intent to shift away from traditional hardware.

In summary, IBM has been involved in some controversial incidents, but it's also contributed significantly to the history of computing. The perception of IBM as being 'bad' would depend on the specific context or criteria one uses to judge the company's actions.
